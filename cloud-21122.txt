ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:

(NOTE: This story will work only if the config. created in CLOUD-18493 is enabled)

# User can upload a file from the manufacturer software in any structure (i.e. columns/fields may vary from one file to another)

# Manufacturer Part Number/Product Reference, Quantity are mandatory fields

NOTE: Each uploaded file must have the Manufacturer Part Number and Quantity. These 2 fields are always required and need to be present in the first 10 columns of the file. Hybris will search for these fields in the first 10 columns only before rejecting the file and throwing an error

# User must be able to upload the file after selecting the manufacturer

a. Uploaded file must match with the template of the manufacturer which is selected by the user

b. If the uploaded file does not match with the template supported by the selected manufacturer, then user will be displayed error message to upload the correct file or select the correct manufacturer or use our standard template (actual text will come from translation file)

c. If the uploaded file matches with the template of selected manufacturer, then upload products from only that manufacturer's catalog in Fast Order

NOTE: If same product reference is found in more than 1 manufacturers, then product from the appropriate manufacturer based on user's selection will be added

d. If no. of products on the file exceeds the configured max limit, then upload the first 'n' products and discard remaining products (where n = configurable max number of rows in the file)

e. Display error message informing the user that some of the products from your file were discarded

# (Regression) Once products are added in Fast Order, automatically update the Product Name for Anonymous Users

# (Regression) Once products are added in Fast Order, automatically update the Product Name, Price, and Stock for Trade Account Users

# (Regression) Product prices displayed must be based on the project selected from the header

# This applies to Desktop only as file upload functionality does not exist on mobile and tablet currently.
