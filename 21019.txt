SET: As a user, I want to also see ‘Mobile Phone number’ field on the registration flow using an existing account, so that I can provide all my contact info.
 
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
# 'Mobile Phone Number' field should be available on registration flow using an existing account
# Below configuration should be available to define 'Mobile Phone Number' field at webshop level
## visible or invisible
## mandatory or optional
## length
## By default, it should be visible and mandatory for Sweden, but invisible and optional for the others.
# Mobile number entered at registration (existing or non-existing account) should be displayed on the Edit User page for that user in User Management
# Mobile number entered at registration (existing or non-existing account) should be displayed on the My profile page for that user
# Phone number validation should be also applied to the new contact field, if applicable (NOTE: using the existing logic: Webshop using phone number validation should keep it also for this addition; Webshop not using phone number validation should not use for this addition either.)
# This should be applied to all breakpoints.
 
 
NOTE:
1)        Registration flow with existing account
Add Mobile Number + Config (hide/visible) + config (mandatory/optional) – should be mandatory by default for Sweden
2)        Registration flow without existing account (Web/ New Trade_Manual/ New Trade_Auto/ Cash)
Include config (mandatory/optional) should be mandatory by default for Sweden
3)        User mgnt page (user creation via company admin)
This is already mandatory, not sure if there’s a config for this
4)        For all touch points, data must be synchronised for the same user
Mobile number entered at registration (existing or non-existing account) should be displayed on the Edit User page for that user in User Management
 
OPEN POINTS (TECH):
How about the existing phone number data? if the mapping is already done to sync the phone number between registration (existing or ATAO) and user mgmt? ([~harish.pai-ext@rexel.com])
