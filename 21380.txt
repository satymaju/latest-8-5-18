SET: As a user searching for products, if I click on a result I would like to consistently go back to the search results page that I was on from the PDP page.
 
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
1) Remove the "back to search results" link on the PDP
2) This link should be removed from all breakpoints
 
NOTE:
https://jira.rexel.com/issues/?jql=%22Rally%20SF%20ID%22%20%3D%20SF906
since we have launched the pagination stories in SF906 which launched in 17.4 we no longer need to have this link in the PDP. This link also behaves incorrectly if a user browses away from the PDP.
 
With this story, user can use either breadcrumb or browser 'go back' option to navigate back
