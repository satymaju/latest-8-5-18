Tech Notes-

A)

1)On the first page we should check whether the file is of old file format or not.- just checking the 1st row of 1st column

2)if it is a old format file then regression. if No we have to show a popup with manufacturer selection.

3)Acc to the selection from the user we have to compare the uploaded file to the correct template.

 

B)

Tracking event should be added to the existing upload button. this is not attached to any config.
