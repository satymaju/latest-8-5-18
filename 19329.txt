SET: As an approver, I want to see clear and colored status labels on my order approval dashboard;
         As a purchaser, I want to see clear and colored status labels on my order approval tab from order history page.
 
WIRES:
The order approval cards in the responsive code has a section called status that needs to be called out more clearly.  The status would be given a colored treatment depending on what the status of that order is.
