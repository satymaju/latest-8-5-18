SET: Remove gradient from combo button arrow section of CTA - Responsive from Saved Cart details page
 
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
# Use the same solid color on both CTA and drop-down arrow section on Saved Cart Details page (Flat, non-gradient primary color of the webshop)
# (Regression) Purely UI change, no impact on function.
# This should be applied to all Webshops on responsive (Tablet and Mobile)
 
NOTE:
The combo button on the "Saved Carts" page uses the primary button color for the CTA and then a gradient for the dropdown with additional options. Each webshop will need to be reviewed to ensure the treatment is consistent.
This is for the responsive site only.
